# NPPDecay

This is our implementation for the paper [Self-Adaptable Point Processes with Nonparametric
Time Decays](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/243facb29564e7b448834a7c9d901201-Abstract.html), by Zhimeng Pan, Zheng Wang, Jeff M. Phillips and Shandian Zhe @  Neurips 2021

# Data Set and Models

All data sets ( including train/test split) we used in the paper reside in the ./data folder, which could be loaded using functions in ./code/data_loader.py. 

We provide code for our proposed algorithm, SPRITE, along with training/evaluation scripts for all date sets. 

# System Requirements

All code were tested under python 3.6 and tensorflow 1.15.0.
